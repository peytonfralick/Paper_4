# IndividualDietVariationSwitching
Data and code for prediction of diet variation in prey switching experiments

This repository includes data extracted from prey switching experiments used to evaluate the ability of a simple stochastic foraging 
model to predict the amount of diet variation within the experiments. Data from the individual studies and the R code to 
extract the necessary data to evaluate the stochastic foraging model can be found in the 'Switching Experiments' folder. The
extracted data and the R code for the analysis of the extracted data can be found in the 'Analysis' folder.
